# regression_building_EUI_predictions
machine learning project to use regression for prediction of commercial building energy use in San Francisco

### Project Purpose and Methodology
To use regression models to predict the energy use intensity of commercial buildings in California, combining information from the San Francisco Commercial Buildings Benchmarking ordinance and SF Open Data as well as property information from the SF Planning Department's Property Information Map. This was one of my first data science projects and was done to practice shallow learning techniques and web-scraping via Selenium and BeautifulSoup.
